# Plex Server

My local plex server for watching my DVD movies

# Setup

Before starting the server make sure the following directories exist

- `/media/jcostanzo/extradrive1/config`
- `/media/jcostanzo/extradrive1/TV Shows`
- `/media/jcostanzo/extradrive1/Movies`

**Note:** If you have files in a different location, you will need to update the compose file with new path
